# Inheritance-and-Polymorphism-Employees

A company Employee (Employee) class is the parent class. This must be an abstract class. The Employee class has a few simple data elements: A name identifier (a string), and a unique identifier the id (also a string). It has the usual getters and setters:  
•	string GetName() const; 
•	string GetId() const; 
•	void SetName (const string& NewName); 
•	void SetId(const string& NewId);
